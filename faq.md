## Subscriptions 

Subscriptions to [JustSketchMe Pro](https://gum.co/justsketchme) are on a periodic license where you will be billed according to the license period you choose. There is also a [one-time payment option](https://gum.co/justsketchme-lifetime/).

You will be issued a license key after payment (it will also be emailed to you).
You can then copy and paste the key into the app to activate all the features in the app.

The same license key can be used on all of your devices.
All devices using the same license key will share saved poses and scenes.
