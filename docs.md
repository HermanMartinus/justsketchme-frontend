## Models

There are many different models and characters that are available to use in the program. The scene come loaded with the female base model. You can add more characters and models to the scene by selecting the <span class="app-tool"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/feather-sprite.svg#users" /></svg></span> button in the top left, and clicking on a model. There are different categories of model in selectable tabs along the top.

## Gizmos

Gizmos are tools that allow you to manipulate objects (models or props) in the scene. They can be thought of as different modes of interacting with the scene. They can be found at the bottom right corner of the screen. Once a gizmo is selected you can select a joint or object by clicking it. Right clicking or clicking away will deselect that joint or object. 

### Rotate

This tool allows you to rotate any joint on a character model into the desired position. This is used to posing the models and rotating props. It is the mode that is active by default and can be re-activated by selecting <span class="app-tool"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/feather-sprite.svg#disc" /></svg></span> or using the shortcut "Q". You can select and drag an individual axis (the coloured circles) or free rotate by selecting anywhere inside the sphere and dragging. 

### Move

This tool allows you to move a character model or prop around the scene. Activate it by selecting <span class="app-tool"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/feather-sprite.svg#move" /></svg></span> or using the shortcut "W". You can select and drag an axis to move it on one axis, or select the square to move it along a plane (2 axis). 

### Scale

This tool allows you to scale a character model or prop. Activate it by selecting <span class="app-tool"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/feather-sprite.svg#maximize-2" /></svg></span> or using the shortcut "E". You can select and drag an axis to scale it along just that axis. Use the semi-transparent squares at the end of each axis to scale the whole model uniformly.
