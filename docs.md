## Models

There are many different models and characters that are available. The scene comes loaded with the female base model by default. You can add more characters and models to the scene by selecting the <span class="app-tool"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/feather-sprite.svg#users" /></svg></span> button in the top left, and selecting a model. There are different categories of model in selectable tabs along the top. 

---

## Gizmos

Gizmos are tools that allow you to manipulate objects (models or props) in the scene. They can be thought of as different modes of interacting with the scene. They can be found at the bottom right corner of the screen. Once a gizmo is selected you can select a joint or object by clicking it. Right clicking or clicking away will deselect that joint or object. 

### Rotate

<span class="app-tool"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/feather-sprite.svg#disc" /></svg></span>
This tool allows you to rotate any joint on a character model into the desired position. This is used to posing the models and rotating props. It is the mode that is active by default and can be re-activated by selecting the button or using the shortcut "Q". You can select and drag an individual axis (the coloured circles) or free rotate by selecting anywhere inside the sphere and dragging. 

### Move

<span class="app-tool"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/feather-sprite.svg#move" /></svg></span>
This tool allows you to move a character model or prop around the scene. Activate it by selecting the button or using the shortcut "W". You can select and drag an axis to move it on one axis, or select the square to move it along a plane (2 axis). 

### Scale

<span class="app-tool"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/feather-sprite.svg#maximize-2" /></svg></span>
This tool allows you to scale a character model or prop. Activate it by selecting the button or using the shortcut "E". You can select and drag an axis to scale it along just that axis. Use the semi-transparent squares at the end of each axis to scale the whole model uniformly. 

---

## Tab tools

These tabs show up in the left side of the screen when new objects are added to the scene. They have tools specific to those objects in them. You can select the model by clicking the image in the tab. 

### Duplicate

<span class="app-tool"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/feather-sprite.svg#copy" /></svg></span>
This will duplicate the object in the scene and create a perfect copy next to it. This is useful for creating multiple props for repetitive constructs (think bars of a prison cell), or for generating multiple characters doing the same thing (think marching soldiers). 

### Flip

<span class="app-tool"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/feather-sprite.svg#repeat" /></svg></span>
This will flip your model horizontally for a perfect mirror image. This is useful for mirroring poses from the pose library (think running).

### Hide joints

<span class="app-tool"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/feather-sprite.svg#eye" /></svg></span>
This will toggle disable/enable and hide/show all the joints on the model so that your scene is cleaner when working on other models. It prevents accidental manipulation of models you're happy with. 

### Delete
<span class="app-tool"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/feather-sprite.svg#trash" /></svg></span>
This will remove the object from the scene.

## Lighting

The program gives you granular control over the scene lighting intensity, direction and type.

### Move light source

There is a yellow sphere in the scene that once selected can be moved around the scene using the [move gizmo](#move).

### Adjust ambient light

In the settings menu <span class="app-tool"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/feather-sprite.svg#settings" /></svg></span> in the top right there is a slider to adjust the ambient light üîÜ intensity. Ambient lighting removes shadows as the intensity increases. 

### Adjust spot light

In the settings menu <span class="app-tool"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/feather-sprite.svg#settings" /></svg></span> in the top right there is a slider to adjust the spot light üí° intensity. The spot light direction comes from the position of the light soure in the scene. Spot lighting creates shadows as the intensity increases. 

### Hard/soft shadows

In the settings menu <span class="app-tool"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/feather-sprite.svg#settings" /></svg></span> in the top right you can enable or disable hard shadows üë§ on the model. Hard shadows give more shadow information. Note that enabling hard shadows may cause lagging on older devices.

## Scene tools

These tools give you access to extra functionality in the scene and can all be found in the settings menu <span class="app-tool"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/feather-sprite.svg#settings" /></svg></span> in the top right.

### Dark mode

üåö Toggle dark mode gives a dark background and menus for reducing eye-strain. 

### Outline effect

üñä Toggling the outline effect disables or enables the dark outline effect on all the objects in scene. 

### Floor grid

üåê Toggling this option enables or disables the floor grid in the scene. 

### Adjust field of view

üé• This slider allows you to set a more extreme field of view to get more intense perspective in the scene (think giant fist perspective).
