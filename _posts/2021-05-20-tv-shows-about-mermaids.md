We've reached the last of our Mermaids in Pop Culture for #mermay series, we hope you've had fun finding some deep-sea treasures and you discovered something fin-tastic. (Sorry)

# The New Adventures of Ocean Girl

The first item on our list is an oddity. An animated Australian series from yesteryear, this lesser-known gem is not afraid of getting weird, even though its targeted demographic is mostly certain young kids.

And when we say weird, we mean it. We’re talking ghastly anthropomorphic deep-sea villains, underwater palaces and lairs straight out of Heavy Metal Magazine and voice acting that can only be described as a mix between macabre and Muppet.

So obviously, a must-watch.

# Siren

Siren is great fodder for those among us with a penchant for binge-watching and ordering in. It’s a mix between CW shows like The Circle, Vampire Diaries and… scary mermaid folklore?

The CGI, although sparingly used, is actually rather good and the divide between the two-legged locals and their feral mermaid counterparts is interesting and intriguing. The tone of mermaid-related media is often either romantic, fish-out-of-water comedy or creature feature horror and by some miracle Siren actually manages to be both.

# Tidelands

Another Australian entry on the list, (do y’all just really like mermaids?) Tidelands released on Netflix a few years back and didn’t garner much fanfare, unfortunately, but has developed a warmer reaction over time.

Tidelands concerns a young, rebellious girl who returns to her home town to… we don’t know exactly. What we do know is that her family is caught up in some kind of illegal fishing activities alongside a group of mysterious outsiders who keep mostly to themselves and can breathe underwater, amongst other quasi-aquatic superhuman traits.

# Legend of the Blue Sea

A pretty straightforward mermaid and landlubber love story from Korea with a nifty gimmick, Legend of the Blue Sea is about two unlikely soul mates locked in a tale of redemption, love and rebirth.

The contemporary story of a mermaid and a con artist is juxtaposed by their spiritual parallels in Joseon-era Korea, and how their tail \[sic\] diverges and converges at key moments.

It’s cute, it’s got mermaids, it’s funny and it’s a good time. Give it a go if you like Splash, The Mermaid (2016) and subtitles.
