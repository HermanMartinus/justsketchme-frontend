Turns out, barring the occasional \[sic\] glitch in your fave open-world game title, ([_cough_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB6XyErBswg&ab_channel=gameranx)) the T-Pose is actually a super useful tool when it comes to character design.

A lot of people's conception of the ol' T doesn't extend far beyond the [meme](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/12/why-the-best-meme-of-the-year-is-t-posing.html) of yesteryear, but here are a few ways you can use it in your upcoming projects.

### Use it to make them looks 

The T Pose is a great way to define every little aspect and detail of an outfit for easier recollection and reproduction. Think about some of your favourite outfits in movies and video games. 

There are some intricate designs out there, and the T Pose allows a team of people to produce artwork and content of the same thing to exact specifications and requirements. It also helps you remember where you put that buckle on your OC's leg.

### Use it to suggest scale 

If you are working with a cast of characters, chances are they are not going to all be of the same height and build. 

Creating a character sheet that includes every of your character's size and stature is a great way to not get mixed up when you are planning and drawing your panels. If Character A is gigantic in one frame and considerably less so in the next, then you're gonna have some trouble keeping things consistent in terms of characterisation and narrative as well.

### Use it to indicate association

Sometimes you'll have multiple characters that belong to the same organization or group, and perhaps they are even wearing the same thing. 

Think about the Dora Milaje from Black Panther and The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. They all belong to the same order, but they are slightly different in their frames and sizes. 

A character sheet like the one above allows you to see how the same outfit or uniform might look on all of them, and keep track of those differences.

### Don't use it as a jumping-off point

The T pose is great for reference and providing information to ensure your characters and designs remain consistent across the board. They are not, however, great for starting off on a design. The stiff and one-dimensional aspect of the pose often has that same effect on everything you are trying to create. Thus, we suggest going about your initial character sketches by showing them _in situ_ or in action and using the T pose to really nail and define whatever is you want to stand out about them.
