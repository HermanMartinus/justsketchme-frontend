Hello


**Herman here from JustSketchMe 👨‍💻**

So much has happened over the past month and a half! JustSketchMe has grown and matured and I've added all kinds of new bells and whistles, as well as a substantial few optimisations. 

I like to think of JustSketchMe as out of beta. That isn't to say there aren't more features and models to come (there are), but this feels like a great milestone. 😊

**Updates:**

- Saving and loading poses  💾
- A preset pose library with base poses to start your project 💃 🕺
- A hand pose library (for all those finicky little joints) 🤙 ✌️ 🤟 🤘 👌
- Wooden mannequin model (for the old-school artists out there) 👨‍🎨
- Basic shapes for props ⬛ 🔴🔷
- UI revamp and better lighting controls 💡
- Speed updates and optimisations ⚡
