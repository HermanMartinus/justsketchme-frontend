I studied Concept Art with M.C: a calm, intelligent presence. During college one could find her ruminating behind a PC monitor, considering her next project. She has only grown in her art style since then! Vibrant, spiritual and mystical, M.C. lets us into her world.

**CM: Quite a lot of your pieces have a lot of elements to them. For example, differing focal points in the environments etc. It must take quite a lot of time to get these things done. So I wanted to know, how do you stick to one piece for so long, and how do you decide when it's finished?**

MC: I am always excited to create something. I have ADHD which is both a blessing and a curse. I can hyper-focus on a piece for hours on end, but I can also become distracted by new ideas which cause me to want to rush a current piece.

The ideas usually come in threes. I've grown a lot since starting this artistic adventure and I intentionally limit myself to a piece until I am 100% sure it's as good as it can be.

It's also important to take breaks in between.

If you feel that the piece is becoming more of an annoyance than a pleasure, walk away for a little bit and do something else, like a traditional sketch or a walk in nature; a little fresh air can make miracles happen.

Even 30 minutes away from a screen or a page can bring new perspectives to art.

**CM: All of your work seems to involve a strong sense of spirituality, either through celestial beings or through an animal presence - does this pertain to any personal beliefs?**

MC: Honestly? I really just like animals more than people. I feel a stronger connection to nature and animals than I do with humans in general.

With regards to celestial aspects, I have always been fascinated with spirituality, religion and the occult. All the hidden things that are often shunned by the general public for being strange and obscure; I like those things.

They inspire me. I am one of those things.

**CM: I can relate to that. Some people say they feel they can rely on animals more because their nature is more apparent, whereas people hide their true natures.**

**What is your dream project and can you tell us a little more about it?**

MC: I've recently gotten to be part of an amazing project that is part of one of my all-time favourite game series', the Elderscrolls as a Freelance Artist. I've always wanted to work on games creating new worlds, creatures and characters and hopefully I'll find my place among people like Eytan Zana, Shaddy Safadi and Darek Zabrocki.

**CM: Oh wow! What are you doing for them?**

I want to be involve in gaming concepts but it's a really new thing so check back with me in a few months.

**CM: Awesome :) That's super exciting! We'll be sure to check back in with you.**

**If you could make your own film, game, comic, what would it be about?**

MC: Tough question. Probably some epic fantasy quest and dark revelations translating to mental illness either being addressed and alleviated or complete and utter destruction directly linked to the ignorance and arrogance of mankind. I love the idea of time travel or rather travelling between planes of existence. There is so much to explore and find in this universe, even on our own planet. We know more about the moon than what goes on within our oceans.

**CM: That's a fair point! I was watching a documentary the other day about brine pools. Have you heard of them? They're pools deep beneath the ocean with salt levels much higher than the rest of the ocean, and some fish get cooked instantly when swimming inside them. So fascinating and mysterious right? Listen, we're getting to the end of our interview, so I wanted to ask you two more questions, on about the past, and one about the future.**

MC: Damn! That's hectic! But the limits are being pushed much farther than before, which is incredibly exciting ✨

\**CM: What would you tell yourself if you could talk to yourself five years before now?

MC:** What I'd tell myself is to breathe. To not let my anxiety and self-doubt get the better of me. To just create and not worry about who's work is better than mine or who isn't going to like it, but to focus on progress and learning what it means to be an artist and enjoying that process to the fullest. Nobody holds you back quite like yourself.

**CM: Damn this is some good advice. I'd tell myself that too!**

MC: Anxiety is an asshat. Poem by M.C

**CM: (chuckles to self) Where do you see yourself in five years?**

MC: I see myself full of paint or in front of a screen, never knowing enough. I'd hope to see myself working for a gaming company and broadening my horizons, but my brother from another mother taught me to never expect anything and you won't get disappointed. It may seem a pessimistic approach to life, but that way you are always surprised and always learning something new about yourself and life as a whole.

**CM: Thanks so much MC! It was great hearing more about your art and process. Good luck with your future endeavours and maybe we can check back in a while and see how you've been getting on!**

MC: Dude you make me feel so special, thank you for this ❤️🌸 I'm seeing my work from a different perspective 🕺🏻
