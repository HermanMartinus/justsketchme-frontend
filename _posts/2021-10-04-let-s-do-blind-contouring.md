## What do you need?

* Something to draw (JustSketchMe's models, animals, objects)
* Something to draw on (paper_/_tablet)
* Something to draw with (Pen, pencil, stylus)

(We used Procreate & iPad mini & apple pencil)

# Task 1

Pick a body type, and select a pose to draw from JustSketchMe's pose library.

Put your pen down and start drawing what you see.

## The rules:

1. Don’t lift your pen
2. Don’t look at the drawing
3. Don’t cheat!
4. When you think you are done, look down and laugh at what you created.

# Task 2

## Tips

Find the contour of the object with your eyes, and let your hand move with your eye as it traces the object.

Take your time.

Don’t worry about controlling the result. It’s not about what you made, it’s about what you learned.
