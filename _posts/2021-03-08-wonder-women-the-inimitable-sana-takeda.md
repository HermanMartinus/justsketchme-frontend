If you’ve ever seen the covers of the highly decorated (and decorative) [_Monstress_](https://imagecomics.com/comics/series/monstress), chances are you’ve cracked the spine to see that the commitment to craft and visual spectacle not only appears throughout but forms the lifeblood of what makes that amazing title work so, _so_ well.

[Sana Takeda]() partnered with [Marjorie Liu]() to produce one of the most intriguing fantasy titles in modern comic history and the superb writing and dense, idiosyncratic art style go hand in hand in making it so.

Takeda got her start working as a designer for SEGA (Yes, that SEGA) and is now reaping the rewards of her knife-sharp art skills as a freelancer.

If you can think of an award in the industry, she’s probably won it, and we honestly have no choice but to stan and stan again.

Take a look at some of her works below and whenever you see her name emblazoned on the cover of a graphic novel, be sure to pick it right up because you will not be disappointed.
