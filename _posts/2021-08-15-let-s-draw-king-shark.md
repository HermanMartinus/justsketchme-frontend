It’s hard to pick a favourite, with Harley Quin showing up again, and fun new misfits like Peacemaker and Polka-Dot Man. But our favourite has to be King Shark! Not to fear, though, our beloved clueless shark makes it out! \[Spoilers!\] So in celebration of this hilarious character, let’s go ahead and make some fun fan art with the help of _JustSketchMe._

King Shark’s adorable (but strong) body fits well with the ‘large male’ mannequin. We mimicked the pose on the King Shark promotional poster, but you might want an action pose? _JustSketchMe_ has a lot of fun options to sift through. Get that angle and pose right, and download a screenshot to your preferred drawing app. We used Procreate and an Apple pencil 1.

We first edited the mannequin to make its arms unrealistically large, and the legs shorter.

Draw a loose sketch over the mannequin, before drawing the final, neat lines. Since we are drawing a shark and not a human, you might have to make a bit of it up as you go. King Shark has almost no neck, beady eyes and a large mouth. To make it easier, I suggest using real shark images as references.

The colouring stage comes last, and it’s quite simple - blue pants, a massive grey body, and a red gummy smile. And now it’s our turn to smile when we have our own King Shark fan art done and dusted!
