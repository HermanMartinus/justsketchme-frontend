We're working on it :) 

The mobile app is in the final stages of being built, and we're getting ready for a Google Play release, hopefull with iOS following. 

In the meantime check out the alpha of the new webapp. It's super fast loading and ultra snappy. The idea is to build out the webapp using this, and have a separate build for mobile apps. Web first technology is so much better in browser.

Hope you're enjoying it :)
