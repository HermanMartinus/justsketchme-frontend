[Peach Momoko](https://peachmomoko.com/) is an absolute star and her work spans various titles and studios and has amassed legions of fans the world over. 

She made time in her busy schedule to have a chat with us and we're super excited to share some of her insight with you, so read on!

### Thank you for having a chat with us. Can you tell us a bit about yourself and your artistic journey?

Thank you for having me.

I started working as an editor for a pornography magazine and they used some illustrations of mine (but I was not really credited). I also did many galleries and art festivals for a few years.

Then got picked up by a horror magazine called, Girl and Corpses Magazine. Which the chief editor invited me to my very first Comic Convention. Doing the shows taught me about comics. I just kept drawing and found myself in my current position.

### Your work is incredible. Did you have any inspirations in developing your art style?

Many things inspire me. It sometimes changes daily… But I do listen to music a lot. And when I am stuck with ideas, I tend to watch murder case documentary films.

### What is the secret (in your opinion) to succeeding in the comic book industry?

Be unique and never late with deadlines.

### Can you run me through your process of taking a work from concept to completion?

I clean my studio and organize my table. Set up tea. And start brainstorming and painting.

### Do you have any tips and tricks you use in your creative process?

To find a song that really fits my feeling, and I paint how I feel... so the process flows naturally.

### You seem like an extremely busy person with so many awesome projects on the Horizon (see what I did there?). How do you find the time to do them all and maintain quality?

I try to maintain the quality but sometimes I will find myself painting something that I am not happy with (quality-wise or approach), and I trash that painting and restart. I hate running into that feeling but in order to level up or maintain something I am happy, it is an inevitable downfall because I learned from such a mistake.

### When you feel overwhelmed, discouraged, or burnt out, what do you do to push through and get things done?

I step away from my canvas and watch a movie or do something to clear my mind.

### What are your opinions on the digital vs traditional art debate?

I don’t think there is any right or wrong answer. And I don’t think it needs to be debated or chosen.

But I do feel when you are just starting (as a child or adult), it is important to start with a traditional pencil/brush on paper/canvas. After learning the traditional medium to a certain level, then I think you can choose for yourself.

### Are there any skills you’re trying to learn at the moment? What is your process of learning new techniques?

I am always trying to learn new skills. For me learning a new technique is by trial and error.

### What would your advice to younger artists starting out in the industry be?

Just keep drawing every day. You never know when opportunities rise.

### What cool things are you working on right now, and where can we follow your journey?

I never tease what I am working on so you will just have to keep track. Anyone can follow my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/peachmomoko60/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/peachmomoko60) for most information.
