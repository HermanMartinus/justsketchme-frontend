### Step 3:
Use your superhero’s outfit to their advantage. When you think about Batman, chances are you can picture him gliding through a cityscape with his cape spread out menacingly.

If your hero has a unique or distinctive element to their costume design, try to incorporate this in their pose and let it guide the way they present themselves.

### Step 4:
Draw!
