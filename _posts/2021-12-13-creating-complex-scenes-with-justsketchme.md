We’ve spoken before about how the save scene function is a life saver when you’re knee deep in creating cool stuff with JustSketchMe, and we stand by it.

With the ability to save complex creations and pick up where you left off at the drop of a hat, you can essentially scope out entire projects pretty quickly and very easily.

But we feel like we have to reiterate it once again and flex what our app is capable of and all its possibilities because of one very important addition to the JustSketchMe mix.

If you’re using JustSketchMe Pro, you must’ve stumbled across our new prop libraries and prop upload feature.

Let’s dive into what makes this feature extra special and what it could mean for you and your workflow:

Fan art

So we’re pretty restricted with what we can upload to the prop library, as we’re bound by copyright laws to not infringe on other’s property and have to pretty much exclusively make use of royalty free or custom design files.

BUT as a user, who is not profiting off of these assets or using them for anything other than your artistic pursuits, you totally can.

So if you’re trying to crank out a lush piece of fan art and you wanna get down to the nitty gritty of Mjölnir’s design and ace every crack and curve then you can upload a file you found and get right to it.

Wanna sketch Thor brandishing said hammer in the middle of Asgard’s great hall? You can!

There are an absolute wealth of free 3D resources on the web so if you’re itching for a specific prop or scene then you don’t have to be at the mercy of our prop rollout and get to creating your next masterpiece ASAP.

Here are some sites that we love and use regularly for our own work:

Panels

Comic books are great, but have you ever tried planning one?

Blocking out a scene and choosing an angle that best portrays and displays the action taking place is a fine, fine art.

With JustSketchMe however, you can do so while having a LOT of room for error.

Here’s how. Open up the app and start dropping in elements that will appear in your scene. Move them around and get them exactly how you imagined, posing your characters as well to ensure you know what needs to go down and how you can go about interpreting it through angles and dynamism.

Then, when the stage is set, pan and zoom the camera accordingly and try to visualise how it might look when drawn or sketched out. Then, when you’ve found a good way to look at the scenario you’re trying to depict, lock the camera and move some of the models or props around within that frame to maximise your reference and get your desired point across.

Environment & background design

It’s really easy to get stuck at the character design phase and just crank out drawing after drawing of fabulously dressed people floating on an empty page.

Backgrounds and environments are of course a very tricky thing to master or even do justice, but there are some clever ways around this challenge courtesy of our fine ol’ app.

Create composite backgrounds by dropping in various elements and gizmos and gadgets that roughly make up the idea in your head and get to tracing.

Yes, we said the devil word. Tracing, or using references as we like to call it, can help guide your hand and acquaint you with shapes and perspective in a beneficial way. Get comfortable with mapping out the idea in your head with things at your disposal and study it by _drawing_ it.

It sounds a bit like an oversimplification, but see the process as an iterative one and relieve yourself from the stress of the end result by just hacking away at something over and over and learning something from it.

Don’t know how to draw a stone staircase surrounded by moss covered pillars straight out of your head? I think that very few people do. So what do? Crank out a reference and get sketching. ;)

Now go forth brethren and be sure to make a scene :P
