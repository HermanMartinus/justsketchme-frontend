Figure drawing is a discipline that traditional artists and animators alike agree should be the cornerstone from which every artist starts their journey. In order to create one's own characters it is absolutely imperative that one develop an internal sense of proportions of the body. What with all the different poses & perspective points- this can be difficult to do!

The task of translating 3-dimensional life into 2 dimensions is a skill that can only be developed with patience, focus and time.

Of course - with the internet abound - we've developed other ways of drawing the figure - hence - enter figure drawing reference.

There are many ways that one can use google and the internet to draw figures, but to really become a wizard at drawing figures, it's probably best to use a multimedia approach. It's not only digital. Personally, I've learned different things through using pencil and paper, going to live and online figure drawing classes, 3d modelling the human figure, just sketch me etc - using timed online figure drawing sites - and these are all good for understanding the human body further. Of course, these are all good general tips for warm-ups and practise, but if you'd like to get a quick overview so you can start creating characters, please see below for using Figure Drawing Reference to create awesome character designs!

Below you will find my suggestions for optimal ways to use Figure Drawing References & Just Sketch Me to create your own characters & poses from your imagination.

Step 1 - Start by warming up. - Use a site like [https://line-of-action.com/](https://line-of-action.com/ "https://line-of-action.com/") to do 30-second gestural poses. You can set a timer to change poses quickly. Be sure to focus on the gesture rather than trying to get every detail in.
