Open the JustSketchMe app and add a sphere and a cylinder to your scene. Use the shape tool to elongate and slim down the cylinder, to resemble an axe's handle.

### Step 2:

Move your broad battle-axe to the center of your handle, and you've got a nice shape to make use of when you're getting down to the details of your next axe concept.

Using the torus shape from the drop-down menu, you can also create an impressive labrys axe, kind of like the one Andromache of Scythia uses in the Charlize Theron action film, _The Old Guard_. 

### Step 6:

Using flattened cone shapes, you can even create a massive pick-axe, perfect for a medieval warrior or knight stepping into the fray. 

Have fun creating your axes and tag us in your creations when you're ready to show the world.
