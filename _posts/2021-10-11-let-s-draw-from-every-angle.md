**_Where do I start?_**

1\. Load up JustSketchMe.

2\. Get something to draw on & something to draw with.

(We used Photoshop & Wacom Intuos)

3\. Pick a Character & Pose from the pose library / make your own pose.

We chose > Combat > “Vampire claws”

**_Draw A Full Turnaround_**

Make a quick sketch of each angle. Don’t spend more than a few minutes on each side.

This will help you grow your 3D perception and anatomy skills!

Tip:

\- Try to use only curves or a straight line (No ‘S’ shapes!)

**_Change Lighting_**

Light and shadow create the illusion of volume!

Practice sketching the same pose with different lighting.

Tip:

These are exercises, not completed drawings.

**_Line of action_**

To make it easier: find the line of action before drawing your pose.

Line of action: The internal line that spans from the head to the feet conveys the action carried out by the figure.

Tip 1:

Imagine the line is connected to the spine.

Tip 2:

**YES NO**

\- Follows the spine ✔

\- Flows with the motion ✔

\- Sits outside the body ❌

\- Goes against the motion ❌

**_What does it teach you?_**

This exercise teaches your brain to see the figure as a whole & rapidly identify the essential essence of what makes a pose interesting. ✔
