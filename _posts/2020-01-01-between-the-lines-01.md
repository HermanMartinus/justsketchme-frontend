Hello


**Herman here from JustSketchMe 👨‍💻**

It's been a crazy week at the workshop. We've been working on some interesting features for the web app, trying to build out a larger following, **and** stay sane. So far we've managed 2 of the 3. I'll let you guess which.

**Updates:**

- Created an undo button (for those pesky mistakes) ↩ 
- Some speed optimizations 🏎
- Conceptualizing saving and loading poses 💾
- Started this newsletter for you fine people 📰

**Interesting reads:**

🧘‍♀ [The Practise of One Thing at a Time](https://zenhabits.net/ichigyo-zammai/)

"What a beautiful idea, that when we aren’t present, our true nature cannot fully express itself … but when we are truly just doing whatever we’re doing, we start to express our true selves.

**Best free tool of the week:**

🎨 [Krita](https://krita.org/)

Krita is a professional FREE and open source painting program. It is made by artists that want to see affordable art tools for everyone.
