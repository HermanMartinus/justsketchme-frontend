				<h2>A drawing tool</h2>
				<p>
						JustSketchMe was built by a duo of game developers who realise that having a wooden mannequin for dynamic poses and posing on hand all the time is fairly inconvenient.
				<br>
				<br>
						This tool has a wooden figurine model, and anatomically correct male and female models, with more being added all the time. It is for figure sketching, fashion design, comic illustration, and whatever else you can think of.
						
						There is an adjustable light source which can be moved around the mannequins, for playing with shadows, highlighting and different thresholds.
