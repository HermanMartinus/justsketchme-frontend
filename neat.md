Henlo frenz, 

Herman, Simon and Dante here. 

Here's our collective list of things we like and think you might too. 

If you have anything to add or suggest, please drop us a [mail](dante@justsketch.me). 

### Things to watch

![](/uploads/dd9w1w9-65452fbb-3ee0-487d-9177-9199c3f83fa1.jpeg)[Drawfee]()

Four friends get together and draw whack things. It really is that simple and also completely not! A wonderful way to spend your time and something truly worthy of your attention, Drawfee is fun, funny and super inspirational to artists everywhere. It's also, as they say, people turning dumb ideas into dumb drawings and... that just sounds really good.

[Thor High Heels](https://www.youtube.com/user/ThorHighHeels) 

Ever wondered what happened to the games of yesteryear forgotten by time and corporate greed? Thor High Heels has truly got you covered. From looks into the libraries of long lost consoles to explorations of your favourite publishers' forgotten games, this channel is a must.

[The Sphere Hunter]()

Speaking of video games, Suzi Hunter of Sphere Hunter fame has got to be one of the best gamers on the ol' Youtube. She does reviews, yes, but she also waxes poetic on her favourite games and does a great job of setting the mood and tone of her videos to the games she's talking about, giving people a double whammy introduction that is as fun as it is informative.

Our regular contributor and super skilled artist Carolina Alvarez is one to watch. Expert skills and hacks and a super great aesthetic is to be found here. Her [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CarlzSays) is a pretty fun place too.

### Things to play

Play cool, little games. 'Nuff said.

[Mythical Creature Generator](https://www.generatormix.com/mythical-creatures-generator)

This site generates random creatures that you probably didn't think of. Great to use as a prompt for drawing or for populating your D&D games with scary nasties. 

[Character Generator](https://www.character-generator.org.uk/)

If you're a writer and you're in need of flexing your muscles, head  here and get a fresh character to use as a jumping-off point for your next scribe session.

### Things to use

[Darek Zabrocki](https://www.deviantart.com/darekzabrocki/art/FREE-PHOTOSHOP-BRUSHES-DAREK-ZABROCKI-BRUSH-SET-431393487) is a renowned artist in his own right, and his brush selection is reeeeal good too.

If you like painting and blending and doing the swoosh things, these [Rezkhan](https://www.deviantart.com/rezshirmeen/art/RezKhan-Brushes-2013-352095320) brushes are super good for that.

[Deharme](https://www.deviantart.com/deharme/art/Deharme-BRUSHES-Photoshop-CC-435479570)'s brush has everything you could ever have wanted from a brush set. That's it, that's the tweet.
