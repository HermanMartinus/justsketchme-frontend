The Sphere Hunter

Speaking of video games, Suzi Hunter of Sphere Hunter fame has got to be one of the best gamers on the ol' Youtube. She does reviews, yes, but she also waxes poetic on her favourite games and does a great job of setting the mood and tone of her videos to the games she's talking about, giving people a double whammy introduction that is as fun as it is informative.
