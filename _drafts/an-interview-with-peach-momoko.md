### Thank you for having a chat with us. Can you tell us a bit about yourself and your artistic journey? 

Thank you for having me. 

I started working as an editor for a pornography magazine and they used some illustrations of mine (but not really credited). I also did many galleries and art festivals for a few years.

Then got picked up by a horror magazine called, Girl and Corpses Magazine. Which the chief-editor invited me to my very first Comic Convention. Doing the shows taught me about comics. And kept drawing and found myself in my current position.

### Your work is incredible. Did you have any inspirations in developing your art style? 

Many things inspires me. It sometimes changes daily… But I do listen to music a lot. And when I am stuck with ideas, I tend to watch murder case documentary films.

### What is the secret (in your opinion) to succeeding in the comic book industry? 

Be unique and never late with deadlines. 

### Can you run me through your process of taking a work from concept to completion? 

I clean my studio and organize my table. Set up tea. And start brain storming and painting.

### Do you have any tips and tricks you use in your creative process? 

To find a song that really fits my feeling, and I paint how I feel... so the process flows naturally. 

### You seem like an extremely busy person with so many awesome projects on the Horizon (see what I did there?). How do you find the time to do them all and maintain quality? 

I try to maintain the quality but sometimes I will find myself painting something that I am not happy with (quality-wise or approach), and I trash that painting and restart. I hate running into that feeling but in order to level up or maintain something I am happy, it is a inevitable downfall because I learned from such mistake.

### When you feel overwhelmed, discouraged, or burnt out, what do you do to push through and get things done?  

I step away for my canvas and watch a movie or do something to clear my mind.

### What are your opinions on the digital vs traditional art debate? 

I don’t think their is any right or wrong answer. And I don’t think it needs to be debated or chosen.

But I do feel when you are just starting (as a child or adult), it is important to start with a traditional pencil/brush on paper/canvas. After learning the traditional medium to a certain level, then I think you can choose for yourself.

### Are there any skills you’re trying to learn at the moment? What is your process of learning new techniques? 

I am always trying to learn new skills. For me learning a new technique is by trial and error.

### What would your advice to younger artists starting out in industry be? 

Just keep drawing everyday. You never know when opportunities rises.

### What cool things are you working on right now, and where can we follow your journey?

I never tease what I am working on so you will just have to keep track. Anyone can follow my Instagram or Twitter for most information.
