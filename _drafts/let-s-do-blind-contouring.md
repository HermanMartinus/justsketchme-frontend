Pick a body type, and select a pose to draw from justsketchme’s pose library.

Put your pen down and start drawing what you see.

**_The rules:_**

1. Don’t lift your pen
2. Don’t look at the drawing
3. Don’t cheat!
4. When you think you are done, look down and laugh at what you created.

**_CARD 3_**

**_Tips_**

Find the contour of the object with your eyes, and let your hand move with your eye as it traces the object.

Take your time.

Don’t worry about controlling the result. It’s not about what you made, it’s about what you learned.

_E, F .png’s, and their drawings._

**_CARD 4_**

**_Tips_**

Try drawing the same pose several times.
