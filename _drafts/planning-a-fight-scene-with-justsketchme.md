So last time we showed you how to plan some [scene](https://justsketch.me/how-to-plan-comic-panels-justsketchme) exposition using JustSketchMe, and we thought why stop there. Here we'll be breaking down how you can use the app in making your fisticuffs come to life before your pen even hits the page, as well as giving you some tips on what makes fight scenes work in the first place.

# Exposition

Any scene, whether they include fighting or not, needs some kind of exposition for it to make sense to the viewer. Let's say that these two would-be combatants consist of a scrappy female hacker wanting to get into a heavily guarded building and an imposing cyborg bodyguard. You don't have to know that per se, but it helps to set them up in a way that suggest he's blocking her path and she's not happy about it.

Next, try misdirecting the viewer even if you both know what's about to go down. She waves him off and leaves, and he returns to his post. oR isS sHeE?!?****

Initiation

Here you could drop a hint to the viewer that something is about to happen, that is incongruent with the narrative up until now. 

Element of Surprise

It's important to remember that every actor in a scene or scenario has a perspective that needs to be conveyed, and by not doing so you will result in a very one-sided and perhaps nonsensical series of events. Try not to focus exclusively on the aggressor or the recipient.

When drawing/ planning particularly significant or spectacular actions, try to conjure some continuity by making the cause and effect of actions performed super clear. It also helps you land that 'Thud' or 'Bang' sound effect you're planning on using.
