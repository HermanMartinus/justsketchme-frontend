Step 01: Create the perfect pose on Justsketchme app

Step 02: do a super rough sketch on top of your Justsketchme model. Just the basic shapes nothing special

Step 03: Clean up your previous sketch and add all the necessary details

Step 04: Start adding a light source. It really helps to use your Justsketchme render as a good lighting reference on top of your sketch and lock the layer down. Do a quick paint over.

Step 05: Create drama and movement by adding lines and more dramatic inky shadows. Try to figure out what elements would move and how you can emphasize that movement. Most importantly have fun! :)
