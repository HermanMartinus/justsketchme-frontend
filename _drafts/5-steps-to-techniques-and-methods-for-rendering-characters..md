Step 1 - Always start by warming up. - Use a site like [https://line-of-action.com/](https://line-of-action.com/ "https://line-of-action.com/") to do 30-second shading poses. Get the darks, mid-tones, and lights in. Get a sense of how little you need in order to communicate a lot! \[insert timelapse of quick shading poses\]

Step 2 - Adjust your own thumbnail according to your intuition. If you compare the thumbnail below to the thumbnail that was approved by my peers in the previous post, you'll see that they are slightly different. This is because there is some adjustment that's needed to be done just through intuition alone. This is a technique I learned from Marta Nael - she creates a thumbnail that is very striking just by using two colours. There's a strong chance that if your thumbnail is strong in the two-tone phase that this will carry through to the final product.
