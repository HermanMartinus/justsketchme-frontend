**_CARD 1_**

**_Where do I start?_**

1\. Load justsketchme.

2\. Get something to draw on & something to draw with.

(We used Photoshop & Wacom Intuos)

3\. Pick a Character & Pose from the pose library / make your own pose.

We chose > Combat > “Vampire claws”

**_CARD 2_**

**_Draw A Full Turnaround_**

Make a quick sketch of each angle. Don’t spend more than a few minutes on each side.

_Figure I.png_

This will help you grow your 3D perception and anatomy skills!

Tip:

\- Try to use only curves or a straight line (No ‘S’ shapes!) _Figure E.png_

**_CARD 3_**

**_Change Lighting_**

Light and shadow creates the illusion of volume!

Practice sketching the same pose with different lighting.

_Figure G.png_

Tip:

These are exercises, not completed drawings.

**_CARD 4_**

**_Line of action_**

To make it easier: find the line of action before drawing your pose.

Line of action: The internal line that spans from the head to the feet that conveys the action carried out by the figure.

_Figure A.png_

_Figure B.png_

Tip:

Imagine the line is connected to the spine.

Tip 2:

Draw circles for the head, ribcage and hips along this line. _Figure H.png_

**_CARD 5_**

_Figure C.png_

**YES NO**

\- Follows the spine ✔

\- Flows with the motion ✔

\- Sits outside the body ❌

\- Goes against the motion ❌

**_What does it teach you?_**

  
This exercise teaches your brain to see the figure as a whole & rapidly identify the essential essence of what makes a pose interesting. ✔
