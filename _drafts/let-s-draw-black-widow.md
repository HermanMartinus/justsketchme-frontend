**How to draw Black Widow with justsketchme?**

Do you love the MCU? Marvel’s Black Widow launched on the 7th and we hope you are just as excited as we are about it!

Black Widow is a fan favourite, and we sure agree. In celebration, let’s take a look at how we can draw a Black Widow of our own with the help of _JustSketchMe._

The superhero section under the pose library is a great place to start. For this tutorial, we picked the Black Cat pose, but you are welcome to browse for a different pose, or style your own unique pose! Take a screenshot when you are happy, and start sketching out your heroine.

Use your posed mannequin as a base and sketch the rough lines over it. You do not need to make final decisions at this stage. Once you have a moderate idea, start with the final lines.

We made our Black Widow look like Scarlett Johansson, but you might picture your black widow differently. The character has sported various hairstyles during the MCU, her hair at times being short and blond, long and curly or Endgame ombre.

We just love her new suit design! Even though we adored the new White Widow, we decided to stick to the classic black outfit. This is a good time to rewatch the movie and trailer until you have a good picture of her new style or use our fan art as a hint.

Maybe you like her old suits better? It’s a good excuse to rewatch the old Avengers movies, again. ;)

And just like that, quickly and simply, justsketchme helps anyone draw their own Black Widow fan art to share with your friends and online communities!
