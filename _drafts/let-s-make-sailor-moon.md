Needing something magical to bide your time while you wait for the apocalypse that is 2020-2021 to end? We have just the thing!

Sailor Moon is right up there as one of the all-time greats, and what better way to celebrate it's pretty, escapist and hilarious charms than to draw your own.

The Sailor Moon challenge last year proved that Usagi and her friends are here to stay, and their inspiration and legacy are endless.

So without further ado, let's make Sailor Moon's iconic pose in JustSketchMe and draw it out step by step.

Have fun, and please share your creations with us.

### Step 1

Go to JustSketchMe and create your pose with the Anime Female V2. Here's a [mini-tutorial]() on how to do so.

Remember that the model is fully rotatable, so you can draw Usagi in this pose from any angle you like. For this tutorial, we're gonna go with the one that is facing head-on, as the most details of the character are visible this way.
