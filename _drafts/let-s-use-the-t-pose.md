Turns out, barring the occasional \[sic\] glitch in your fave open-world game title, ([_cough_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB6XyErBswg&ab_channel=gameranx)) the T-Pose is actually a super useful tool when it comes to character design.

A lot of people's conception of the ol' T doesn't extend far beyond the [meme](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/12/why-the-best-meme-of-the-year-is-t-posing.html) of yesteryear, but here are a few ways you can use it in your upcoming projects.

### Use it to make them looks 

The T Pose is a great way to define every little aspect and detail of an outfit for easier recollection and reproduction. Think about some of your favourite outfits in movies and video games. 

There are some intricate designs out there, and the T Pose allows a team of people to produce artwork and content of the same thing to exact specifications and requirements. It also helps you remember where you put that buckle on your OC's leg.

### Use it to suggest scale 

If you are working with a cast of characters, chances are they are not going to all be of the same height and build. 

Creating a character sheet that includes every of your character's size and stature is a great way to not get mixed up when you are planning and drawing your panels. If Character A is gigantic in one frame and considerably less so in the next, then you're gonna have some trouble keeping things consistent in terms of characterisation and narrative as well.
