Long ago, in a galaxy far, far away, very serious and disciplined people in robes slashed and sliced at each other with shiny swords made of light and we will never stop being jealous. Watch our tutorial on how you can shape your own lightsaber in [justsketch.me](justsketch.me "app") to use as drawing reference in any Star Wars related sketch or illustration. Have fun, and tag us in your creations!
