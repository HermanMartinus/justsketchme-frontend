Alright, so earlier this week we gave you guys the rundown on the clone feature, which you can check out [here](https://justsketch.me/new-justsketchme-feature-clone) if you haven’t already.

Another newbie is the ability to flip and we know you guys have been requested this for months so don’t all… flip out at once.

So with the flip feature, you can mirror any pose that you’ve created as well as the pre-saved poses available with the paid tier.
