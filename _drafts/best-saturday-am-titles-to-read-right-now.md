So seeing as we’e teamed up with one of the coolest manga publishers on the planet, we thought we’d give you guys some pointers on what series to pick up and what they are all about.

Saturday AM, Saturday PM, and Saturday Brunch are all BRIMMING with insanely cool comics that are just begging to be read, but if you’re unfamiliar with the Shonen Jump style monthly anthology vibes here are a few titles to get you started and to get you _invested._

**Apple Black**

\- Is written and created by Nigerian artist Odunze

Oguguo. Also known online as "Whyt Manga"

Blessed with the ‘arm of God’ called Arodihs, the young sorcerer,

Sano, attempts to fulfill his prophesied destiny as savior of the

world called the Trinity. Despite ominous visions trying to

steer him down a darker path, Sano is determined to

protect the world while trying to uncover the source of

power that is APPLE BLACK.

The story runs within Saturday AM exclusively and has

two graphic novel collections available with a third

**Clock Striker**

and the current Illustrator is Issaka Galadima

  
Clock Striker follows Cast, a young apprentice or “striker”

on her journey to become a full-fledged SMITH. They are a

legendary fraternal order of WARRIOR ENGINEERS who seemingly

disappeared years ago. While few members were women or people

of color, Cast is determined to break that mold thanks to her mentor - the only female SMITH, Ms. Philomena Clock. The story

runs within Saturday AM exclusively and the graphic novel

collections will be revealed in 2021.

**Saigami**

\- Is written and created by Hungarian Artist Andrea OtÍlia Doney

Hanasaki Ayumi can't quite find her place in the world with every

day being one of emptiness and loneliness. But on the day she

receives a mysterious letter, everything changes. Finding herself

in a frightening new world full of unexpected adventures and

fanciful characters, she joins in the journey of two

adventure-seeking young men. Hoping that she'll find

a way home, Ayumi soon realizes that the more time she

spends in this strange, new world, the more she gets

tangled up within it and the greatest questions

of all: Who is she? and Where does she belong? The story

runs within Saturday AM exclusively and has two graphic novel

collections available for purchase online.

Apple Black, Clock Striker, and Saigami

can be read from start to finish
