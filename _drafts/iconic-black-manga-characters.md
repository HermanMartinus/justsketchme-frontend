### Atsuko Jackson

While the star of _Michiko & Hachin_, Michiko Malandro, is equally worthy of being on this list, it is her arch-nemesis Atsuko Jackson that really shines out as an exceptionally intriguing and iconic character. 

Growing up alongside Michiko in a South American orphanage, the two women would go on to lead wildly different lives. Whereas Michiko chose a life of rebellion and crime, Atsuko sought to carve herself a more legitimate life working with the police and quickly rose through the ranks as a tough and relentless lawmaker. 

She is incredibly vicious and hellbent on destroying Michiko forever, as she endured harsh bullying and torment at her hands throughout her youth. Let me tell you that there is nothing that can prepare you for these ladies' epic beatdowns, and they are an absolute triumph in terms of animation and unbelievably fun to watch.
