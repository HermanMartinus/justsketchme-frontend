### Afro Samurai 

You'd be hard-pressed to find another character as well versed in the art of killing as the inimitable Afro Samurai. 

A lone swordsman on a quest for revenge, Afro Samurai is at the centre of a story so crazy, deranged and hyperbolic that it could only exist in anime form. A revenge saga for the ages, there's no way you can watch this quiet and determined warrior cut his way to vengeance and not walk away thinking it is one of the coolest things you've ever seen.

In a feudal yet futuristic world, populated by cyborgs and ninjas and men with giant teddy bears on their heads, Afro Samurai is still the coolest of the crop and will go down in history for being badass, savage and slick as hell.

### Yoruichi Shih≈çin

A former Shinigami captain and also sometimes a cat, Yoruichi is a formidable warrior and knowledgable asset to the ragtag cast of would-be soul reapers in _Bleach_.

Yoruichi is one, if not the fastest, characters in _Bleach_ and is highly skilled in the arts of Hoho, Hakuda and Shunpo. She holds the title of 'Flash Goddess' and has been known to decimate entire armies with her speed and agility. 

She has a rich and complicated past, being born into nobility and leaving the ranks of the Shinigami to pursue a different life. Her rivalry with fellow Soul Reaper Sui Fong is also extremely intriguing, and their frenetic and super-fast fight is one of the best of the entire series.

### Atsuko Jackson

While the star of _Michiko & Hachin_, Michiko Malandro, is equally worthy of being on this list, it is her arch-nemesis Atsuko Jackson that really shines out as an exceptionally intriguing and iconic character. 

Growing up alongside Michiko in a South American orphanage, the two women would go on to lead wildly different lives. Whereas Michiko chose a life of rebellion and crime, Atsuko sought to carve herself a more legitimate life working with the police and quickly rose through the ranks as a tough and relentless lawmaker. 

She is incredibly vicious and hellbent on destroying Michiko forever, as she endured harsh bullying and torment at her hands throughout her youth. Let me tell you that there is nothing that can prepare you for these ladies' epic beatdowns, and they are an absolute triumph in terms of animation and unbelievably fun to watch.
