### Step 1

Add a cylinder and a cone to your scene. You can rotate the cylinder first so that it is diagonal. 

### Step 2

Use the Shape tool to elongate and thin out the cylinder into a spear-like shape. Use the shape tool on the cone as well and flatten and sharpen it to resemble a spear's tip. 

### Step 3

Use the move tool to position the cone at the top of the spear. You can also move it so that it slightly overlaps with the cylinder, so that it looks like the spear head is lodged into the staff. 

### Step 4
