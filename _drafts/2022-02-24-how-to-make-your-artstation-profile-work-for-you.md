I was scrolling through ArtStation, as one does, and as always I was so incredibly impressed by the dizzying array of talent on display.

An ArtStation profile allows you and your work to be taken seriously and also, more importantly, perhaps, makes it clear that you are a professional in your creative field and willing to accept work and tinker away at cool projects.

It is very much the creative LinkedIn, but I noticed that a lot of the profiles I was browsing were missing crucial information or went about things a little.. strangely.

So I, an unqualified viewer of your staggeringly creative profiles, thought I’d weigh in and give some tips about how you can go about making sure your ArtStation profile does some heavy lifting.

This seems obvious and mundane, but there were so many profiles without clear contact information or links to places where people can reach out to you.

Sometimes a thumbnail would look kind of appealing and I’d open it only to realise that the thumbnail wasn’t anywhere near the main selling point of the image/ render at hand. Choose your thumbnails carefully and try to zone in on something that would compel people to click.

So many artists pour all of their accomplished works into a single project and it really diminishes the overall breadth and scope of their pieces. I think laying them all out as individual projects is way more attractive to a viewer, except of course where they are explicitly related like different angles of the same render etc.

Process work is really vibrant, iterative and interesting. I really liked stumbling across artists who put their scribbly process work up alongside their more polished pieces and it just bodes really well for the overall vibe. Think of it like an art school journal, where the good stuff and the process stuff are always kind of side by side.

So yeah, there are my two cents. Once again, not a professional illustrator here just a keen ArtStation browser and purveyor of fine creative goods who sometimes hires people to make fine creative goods. :D
