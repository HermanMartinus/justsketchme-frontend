### **Step one**: 

Overlay JustSketchMe on your selected background, set the opacity to 50% and rough sketch the basics, like the eye placement and key elements of the costume. Pro tip: Keep all your references close to your sketch that you can turn on and off when you get stuck.

### **Step two**: 

I always start with the face and the more detailed elements like the hands, hair and feet.

### **Step three**: 

Add extra details like buttons folds and darker armour elements

### **Step four**: 

Add a colour base, each colour on a separate layer so you can easily change it when needed.

### **Step Five**: 

Add any extra detail like shadows and highlights. Pro-tip: Add the shadows like a solid colour on a separate layer so you can just adjust the opacity instead of the colour.
