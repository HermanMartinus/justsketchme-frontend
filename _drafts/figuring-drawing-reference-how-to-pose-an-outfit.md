Outfits and costume are essential to creating a character and expressing who they are and what they are about.

But we often run into trouble when trying to:

1. convey who that character is through their costume in the first place
2. Posing both the character and their outfit in a relevant and interesting way.

You know sometimes it is just so easy to deck your highland warrior out in a flowing cape and a hulking great sword and set off to make them cool and dynamic. Then, when the sketch is nearing the final stages you realise to your utmost horror that you posed them like a pious nun and not at all like a fierce warrior.

Just like poses can convey action and intention in a scene, they can also work alongside other visual aspects like costume design to annunciate elements of your character and help the reader or viewer to contextualise them and even understand them as a person, and not just a character.
