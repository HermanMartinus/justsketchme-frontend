### Nillin Cartier-Wells

Starring in the super underrated game _Remember Me_, Nilin is a memory hacker that hails from a cyberpunk-y futuristic Paris and sets off to uncover her past and a wealth of technocratic conspiracies after having her own memory wiped. 

Developed by Dontnod games of _Life is Strange_ fame, _Remember Me_ is by no means a perfect game but it is damn interesting and visually stunning. 

Nilin is also an absolute rarity, a black female protagonist in a AAA game. If you can find it, try giving this game a go as it is a breath of fresh air in an otherwise stale and male-oriented genre.

### Jax and Jacqui Briggs

Jax has been a keen fixture in the fight for the realms throughout the _Mortal Kombat_ series. His mechanised arms and tough demeanour is absolutely iconic, and we've seen him ripped people limb from limb and conquering the Outworld hordes for years and we're still not complaining. 

In _Mortal Kombat X_, we're introduced to his daughter, Jacqui Briggs, sporting her own versions of his iconic weapons, but in the form of a partial exoskeleton that is attached to her arms and legs. 

The Briggs family, now fighting side by side in their pursuit to save their beloved Earthrealm, are absolute powerhouses and we have no choice but to stan.

The quintessential tough guy with a big heart, Barrett Wallace rocketed t fame after appearing in the original _Final Fantasy VII_ and his appearance in last year's stellar remake has done nothing but increase his popularity and cement the reasons he is one of the most iconic black characters in video games. 

Sporting a railgun attached to his arm and a massive vendetta against the horrible Shinra Corporation, Barrett is determined to make the world a better place for his adopted daughter Marlene to grow up in.
