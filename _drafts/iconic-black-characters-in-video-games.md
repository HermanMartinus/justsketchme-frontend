### Nillin Cartier-Wells

Starring in the super underrated game _Remember Me_, Nilin is a memory hacker that hails from a cyberpunk-y futuristic Paris and sets off to uncover her past and a wealth of technocratic conspiracies after having her own memory wiped. 

Developed by Dontnod games of _Life is Strange_ fame, _Remember Me_ is by no means a perfect game but it is damn interesting and visually stunning. Nilin is also an absolute rarity, a black female protagonist in a AAA game. If you can find it, try giving this game a go it is a breath of fresh air in an otherwise stale and male-oriented genre.
