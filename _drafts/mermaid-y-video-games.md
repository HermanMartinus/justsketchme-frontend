So you might not be surprised to hear that finding mermaid video games was a little challenging. Why is there a dearth in bracing, fantastical underwater adventures? I have no idea, dear reader, and hopefully #Mermay2021 is the end to such negligence. 

Nevertheless, we persevered and found you some mermaid-_esque_ and mermaid adjacent video games to enjoy while you ponder the wonders of the seven seas. 

(Note: We expressly left out mermaid characters that appear in otherwise decidedly un-oceanic games, like Queen Marina from Dragon Quest and Irenes from Chrono Cross, because that would be cheating.)
